# Data-Driven-Sales-Trend

**Project Overview:**
  This project, “Data-Driven Sales Trends,” began as an exploration into how data analytics can uncover actionable insights for improving business performance. The idea started from a need to understand how sales evolve over time — identifying key factors driving     performance, recognizing underperforming areas, and predicting potential growth opportunities. Using Python for data analysis and visualization, the project aims to transform raw sales data into a clear story that supports data-driven decision-making. The analysis focuses on real-world business questions that sales managers and strategists frequently face.
