# üìä Data-Driven Sales Trends

## Applying the APPASA Framework  
*(Ask ‚Äì Prepare ‚Äì Process ‚Äì Analyze ‚Äì Share ‚Äì Act)*  

This project follows the framework I learned from **Google Data Analytics Professional Certficate**, where I ultilized the **APPASA** framework to transforming raw sales data into actionable business insights. My analysis leverages Python along with various libraries package like pandas, and visualization libraries to uncover key sales trends across a full year of data and provide recoommendations to the stakeholders.

## PREPARE
**Data Source**  
Twelve monthly sales CSV files covering a full year of transactions.  
Each file includes **order date**, **product name**, **quantity**, **price**, and **purchase address**.

**Data Preparation Steps**  
- Combined all 12 monthly files into a single dataset using `pd.concat()` for comprehensive yearly analysis.  
- Cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates and handling missing values.  
- Converted columns to appropriate data types (`Order Date` to datetime, numeric columns to int/float).  
- Extracted useful information such as month, city, and hour from existing columns.  
- Created new calculated fields, including `Sales = Quantity * Price`.

This created a clean and consistent dataset ready for analysis.

## PROCESS
**Data Cleaning and Transformation**  
1. **Merge datasets:** Used `pd.concat()` to combine monthly data.  
2. **Handle missing data:** Removed rows with null values or incorrect entries.  
3. **Create calculated fields:** Added total sales column (`Sales = Quantity * Price`).  
4. **Extract features:**  
   - `Month` from `Order Date` for monthly trend analysis.  
   - `City` extracted from `Purchase Address` for geographic comparison.  
   - `Hour` extracted from `Order Date` for time-based insights.  
5. **Filter logic:** Removed invalid rows such as ‚ÄúOrder Date‚Äù text headers within the data.

**Tools Used**  
Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, datetime.

## ANALYZE

### 1. Which month had the best sales, and how much revenue did it generate?
The dataset was grouped by month using `groupby('Month')` and total sales were summed.

- **Result:** December had the highest sales.  
- **Revenue:** Approximately **$4.6 million** (example value; replace with your real result).  
- **Insight:** This spike likely results from increased holiday shopping demand, making Q4 the most profitable quarter.

### 2. Which city achieved the highest sales overall?
Using the `Purchase Address` column, the city name was extracted to analyze regional performance.

- **Result:** San Francisco generated the highest overall revenue.  
- **Insight:** The city‚Äôs high population density and purchasing power may have contributed to stronger sales.  
- **Recommendation:** Focus future marketing efforts on high-performing urban areas.

### 3. What time of day should advertisements be displayed to maximize purchases?
The `Order Date` column was converted to datetime, and the hour was extracted to identify when customers placed orders.

- **Result:** Peak order times were between **10 a.m. and 7 p.m.**  
- **Insight:** Sales activity rises steadily through the morning, peaking in the early evening.  
- **Recommendation:** Schedule online ads and email promotions during these hours to increase conversion rates.

### 4. Which products are most often sold together?
By identifying orders with duplicate `Order ID`s, combinations of products bought together were analyzed using `itertools.combinations` and `Counter`.

- **Result:**  
  - **iPhone** and **Lightning Charging Cable** were most frequently purchased together.  
  - **Google Phone** and **USB-C Cable** also appeared often.  
- **Insight:** Customers tend to buy accessories alongside main products, suggesting strong cross-sell opportunities.  
- **Recommendation:** Offer bundle deals or ‚Äúfrequently bought together‚Äù promotions.

### 5. Which product sold the most, and why?
Product quantities were summed and compared to price per unit to understand demand patterns.

- **Result:** **AAA Batteries (4-pack)** were the most sold item by volume.  
- **Insight:**  
  - Lower-priced essential items drive higher quantity sales.  
  - Products with lower unit prices sell in larger volumes but contribute less to total revenue compared to high-ticket items.  
- **Recommendation:** Maintain stock availability for frequently purchased, low-cost items while promoting accessories with high profit margins.
